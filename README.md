# Parsley GUI Debugger

[Parsley](https://github.com/j-mie6/Parsley) is a fast parser-combinator library for Scala based on
Haskell's [Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec).
This is a companion library aimed at providing a graphical debugger for your parsers written using
Parsley, ala ANTLR's `grun` command.

This project uses [ScalaFx](https://www.scalafx.org/) as its graphics user interface backend.

## Issues

This is still a very new library, so expect some bugs as both this library and Parsley 4 updates.
Feel free to use the Issues page to report any issues found with the library.
